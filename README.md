#Project - Nuissance Reporting Angular App
Welcome to my Angular Project, the final class project for CMPT 272 at SFU.

Overview
SuperheroApp is an Angular application designed to streamline crime reporting through an intuitive map interface powered by the OpenStreetMap API. Users can report incidents, log in securely using a secret password to manage and view reports, and conveniently browse and sort through reported incidents on the main page.

Features
Map-based Crime Reporting: Utilize the power of OpenStreetMap API to report incidents through an interactive map.
Secure Login: Users can log in securely using a secret password to manage and view their reports using Hashify API.
Efficient Report Management: Easily view and sort through reported incidents on the main page for a seamless user experience.
Temporary Database Usage: To facilitate data storage and retrieval, we've used a temporary database. This ensures that reported incidents are efficiently stored and can be retrieved as needed for seamless functionality.
